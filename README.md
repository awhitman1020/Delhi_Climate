# Delhi Climate

##
This repository contains a jupyter notebook file with a time series analysis of Delhi climate from the years 2014 to 2017.  To access the Jupyter Notebook, simply click on the "Delhi Climate Analysis and Prediction" in the main.  The dataset is from Kaggle and was originally collected using the Weather Underground API.

## Tools
The analysis and predictive models were completed using pycaret.  Pycaret is a low-code package used for machine learning and forecasting.  Their time series modeling just arrived in their latest update and had some issues installing.  To get around that I created a virtual environment and used that kernel for the notebook.  

## Inspiration
I did this analysis to practice modeling time series and get a better understanding of pycaret.  Pycaret was pretty easy to work with and has solid documentation and tutorials online to get started.
